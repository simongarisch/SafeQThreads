'''
defines the classes:
-> SafeQThread (inherits from QtCore.QThread) and
-> SafeWorker (inherits from QtCore.QObject)
-> SafeThread (inherits from threading.Thread)

Objects for each of these classes will have a stop_running attribute (bool)
that we can set to True if we want to indicate this thread should exit early.

a close_all_threads function is also provided that will:
-> for all SafeQThread objects set the object attribute stop_running to True and call thread.quit()
-> for all SafeThread objects set the object attribute stop_running to True
-> wait for all SafeQThread objects to exit subject to a timeout of max_wait_seconds
